# Project Implementation Checklist

> **Context**  
> This checklist is based on the [PRD](./PRD.md) and is intended to help break down the development plan into manageable steps. We incrementally build features, ensuring each step is testable before moving on.

---

## 1. Requirements & Design (Weeks 1–2)

> **Goal**: Finalize user flows, data models, and decide on architectural patterns.

1. **User Stories & Flows**  
   - Ensure all user actions (swiping, group creation, viewing top cravings, etc.) are clarified with flows.  
   - Confirm design of system states: daily meter, group vetoes, personal analytics.

2. **Data Modeling**  
   - Define structure for user objects (profile, cravings, swipes).  
   - Plan group data schema (group membership, aggregated top cravings).

3. **Technical Architecture**  
   - Decide on Firebase vs. alternative BaaS for real‐time updates.  
   - Discuss Python backend structure (e.g., Flask vs. FastAPI).  
   - Clarify responsibility boundaries between Flutter frontend and Python backend.

> **Verification**:  
> - Conduct a design review to ensure all major requirements are captured.  
> - Validate feasibility of key flows with sample data.

## 2. MVP Backend (Weeks 2–3)

> **Goal**: Implement a basic Python API + Firebase data storage for user/group functionality.

1. **API Setup**  
   - Create endpoints for CRUD operations on users and groups.  
   - Handle swiping actions (like/dislike/neutral) and store them in Firebase.

2. **Firebase Integration**  
   - Integrate Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore for storing user profiles, swipes, daily meters, etc.  
   - Implement user authentication checks with Firebase tokens in the Python backend.

3. **Group Aggregation Logic**  
   - Build minimal logic to compute a group's top cravings (simply rank by frequency).  
   - Set up endpoint for group veto and track veto usage.

> **Verification**:  
> - Write unit tests for each endpoint: user creation, group creation, craving updates.  
> - Ensure data sync works: swipes in DB are reflected in group aggregates.

---

## 3. MVP Frontend in Flutter (Weeks 3–4)

> **Goal**: Create basic UI: daily meter, swiping feed, simple group screen.

1. **Authentication & Basic Navigation**  
   - Connect Flutter to Firebase Authentication (social/email logins).  
   - Implement simple screens: LoginScreen, RegisterScreen, HomeScreen.

2. **Video Feed**  
   - Integrate video player plugin for short food videos.  
   - Implement swiping actions that send user responses (like, dislike) to the backend.

3. **Daily Craving Meter**  
   - Display a progress indicator that increments with each swipe.  
   - Reflect partial vs. full daily meter states.

4. **Group Screen**  
   - Show group name, member list, and top craving.  
   - Provide a button to veto the top item (sending a request to the backend).

> **Verification**:  
> - Validate clickable swipes properly update daily meter and craving data.  
> - Confirm group screen updates after each user's swipe or veto.

---

## 4. Testing & Refinement (Weeks 4–6)

> **Goal**: QA, bug fixes, and minor improvements before first open testing phase.

1. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**  
   - Recruit a small set of testers to try swiping, forming a group, and verifying the daily meter logic.  
   - Gather feedback on any UI or UX pain points.

2. **Bug Fixes & Refinements**  
   - Address high‐priority issues in backend logic or data handling.  
   - Improve UI transitions, loading states for network requests.

3. **Basic Analytics**  
   - Track simple metrics (e.g., daily swipes, completion of meter, group veto usage).  
   - Verify all analytics events are correctly logged (optional integration with Firebase Analytics).

> **Verification**:  
> - Confirm major bugs are resolved; ensure consistent user experience.  
> - Potentially freeze MVP scope to avoid feature creep.

## 5. Enhancing Restaurant & Recipe Suggestions (Post‐MVP)

> **Goal**: Extend the basic recommendations to something more dynamic.

1. **Restaurant Suggestions**  
   - Integrate external APIs (e.g., Yelp or Google Places) to fetch real data.  
   - Match top cravings with local restaurant menus if possible.

2. **Recipe Suggestions**  
   - Provide a simple curated list of recipes or fetch from a recipe API.  
   - Display relevant details (ingredients, prep times) in the app.

3. **Content Management**  
   - Allow users to post short videos/photos of their food.  
   - Possibly add tags or categories to user‐generated content.

> **Verification**:  
> - Confirm external APIs return valid data.  
> - Evaluate how effectively suggestions match user/group cravings.

---

## 6. Advanced Features & Next Steps

> **Goal**: Plan for expansions beyond the initial milestone.

1. **Advanced ML Recommendations**  
   - Move beyond frequency‐based ranking to more personalized machine learning.  
   - Potential use of collaborative filtering or neural networks for robust suggestions.

2. **Rich Social Features**  
   - Introduce user comments, sharing, or in‐app messaging.  
   - Add advanced media editing or AR filters for food videos.

3. **Scalability**  
   - Monitor usage and consider containerizing the Python backend for larger deployments.  
   - Migrate to a microservices approach if needed for performance and maintainability.

> **Verification**:  
> - Conduct performance testing in a staging environment.  
> - Evaluate future plugin or service integrations (CDN for videos, etc.).

### Summary

This **Project Checklist** ensures a logical progression from fundamental functionalities (like user swipes, daily meters) to more advanced group features and recommendation engines. Each phase stands alone for testing and verification, preventing complex dependencies from overwhelming the team early on. Components can be revisited and enhanced later (e.g., advanced ML or richer social features), aligning with the evolving needs of users.
